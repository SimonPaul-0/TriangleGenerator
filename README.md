# Triangle Program
## Overview

The Triangle Program is a simple Python script that prints a triangle pattern based on user input. The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows and the character to be used for the triangle. It then generates and displays the triangle pattern.
## Usage
### 1.Run the Program:
- Execute the script in a Python environment:

    ```bash
    python triangle-creator-with-spaces.py
    ```
    ```bash
    python triangle-creator-compact.py
    ```
### 2. Input:
- Enter the number of rows for the triangle.
- Specify the character you want to use for the triangle.

### 3. Results:

- The program will generate and print the triangle pattern.
### 4. Files
- **triangle-creator-with-spaces.py:** The Python script for generating triangle patterns (with spaces in between).
- **triangle-creator-compact.py:** The Python script for generating triangle patterns (with no spaces in between).
