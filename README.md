Diamond Program
Overview

This Python program generates a diamond pattern based on user input. The user specifies the size of the diamond by entering an odd number. The program then prints a diamond pattern with asterisks.
How to Use :

    Run the program by executing the Python script (diamond.py).
    Enter the size of the diamond (an odd number) when prompted.
    The program will generate and display the diamond pattern.

Notes :

    The input must be an odd number for the diamond to be symmetric.
    The program handles invalid input by printing an error message and exiting.
